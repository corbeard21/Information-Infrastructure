## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

A few of the pieces of artwork that caught my eye at the Eiteljorg Museum were the beadwork creations. I felt like there should have been more in depth storytelling with how they were displayed in the museum. If I were to make a website for this particular form of art, it would include the history of the practice, the culture it originated from, the process of how to do it, and have an interactive section to try it out digitally.

### Core Webpages

Home Page- This page would have the basic history of how beadwork began. It would also have a small grid showcasing all the different cultures who practice the style of art.

Process Page - The content on this page would have images and diagrams that included how to start a beadwork piece.

### Design Choices
