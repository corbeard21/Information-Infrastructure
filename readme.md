### Websites vs Web Applications

**Websites have limited interactivity aside from displaying content. When it comes to web applications, they offer more interactive features and more functionality to allow whoever is using them to complete tasks within the app. Websites can include sites such as small businesses or blogs, and apps are more or less centralized on their own brand or company.**
