### Websites vs Web Applications

---

> **Websites have limited interactivity aside from displaying content. When it comes to web applications, they offer more interactive features and more functionality to allow whoever is using them to complete tasks within the app. Websites can include sites such as small businesses or blogs, and apps are more or less centralized on their own brand or company.**

### VS Code & Extensions

---

> _Visual Studio Code is a coding application that allows users to create HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It can also incorporate functions such as JavaScript and markdown code to include images, website links and lists. The extensions being used in this particular class are as follows:_

1. Prettier
2. Live Server
3. Auto Rename Tag

### Markdown & Documentation

---

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is designed to help format plain text that can be converted to HTML structure. Symbols such as brackets, parentheses, astrisks, hashtags and underscores are considered markdown language. These forms of markdown can make words bold or italic, add images or links to other sites, create ordered or unordered lists, and create category tables.
