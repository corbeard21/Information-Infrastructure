            My name is Corinne Beard. I live in Coatesville, Indiana. I am currently 21 years old and will have been crocheting for almost one whole year in March of this year. My favorite projects to make are amigurumi stuffed animals, as well as simple accessories. The biggest projects that I have completed are a blanket, a sweater, and a large oversized patchwork cardigan. 
            I plan to create even more fun and adorable pieces this year, and maybe even start working a booth for farmers markets, fairs, etc. I can't wait to see what kinds of new projects I'll make this year. Stay tuned for more.
