## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

A few of the pieces of artwork that caught my eye at the Eiteljorg Museum were the beadwork creations. I felt like there should have been more in depth storytelling with how they were displayed in the museum. If I were to make a website for this particular form of art, it would include the history of the practice, the culture it originated from, the process of how to do it, and have an interactive section to try it out digitally.

### Core Webpages

Home Page- This page would have the basic history of how beadwork began. It would also have a small grid showcasing all the different cultures who practice the style of art.

Process Page - The content on this page would have images and diagrams that included how to start a beadwork piece. It would also include video tutorials and downloadable patterns.

DIY Page - I would incorporate a page that is dedicated for people to try and create a digital beadwork art piece of their own with an interactive beadweaving attribute. Another thing to add would be a gallery of user submissions, showcasing all the differing designs and ideas.

### Design Choices

When it comes to beadwork, this form of art uses a wide rainbow array of colors. Designing this webpage would include a lot of bright pastel colors, like light yellows and blues, possibly some pinks.The background of the website would probably be a subtle mosaic type design to tie in with the overall bead aesthetic.
