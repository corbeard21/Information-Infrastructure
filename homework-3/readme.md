### Key Takeaways

When it comes to Javascript, you need to make sure each element is paired properly and defined in order for it to properly work on your page. You can manipulate the title as long as you have the proper ID listed on your page. You can also manipulate how many items you may have on a list. Even if the item is not on your HTML file, you can use Javascript to create a list item instead. Using a loop within your JS will ensure that it will include all of your items or elements, whether or not it is defined on your HTML file. It can work for images as well. Once you have ensured everything else has been defined, you can use img tags within JS and link them to your loop in order to see them on your page.
